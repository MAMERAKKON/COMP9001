# COMP9001
FINAL PROJECT of COMP9001

This is a terminal-based virtual plant care game where you can grow, water, fertilise, and harvest various types of plants. Each plant has its own cost, growth duration, and base selling price. Take care of your plants daily, manage your money wisely, and earn rewards by harvesting fully grown plants. Simple commands and a relaxing gameplay loop make it a fun way to practice programming and resource management.
